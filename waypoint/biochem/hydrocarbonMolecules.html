<h4>Hydrocarbon Molecules</h4>

Covalently linked carbon atoms in biomolecules can form linear chains,
branched chains, and cyclic structures.  This bonding versatility
likely led to the selection of carbon
compounds for the molecular machinery of cells during the origin
and evolution of living organisms.  No other element can form
molecules of such widely different sizes, shapes, and composition.
<p>

Most biomolecules can be regarded as derivatives of hydrocarbons, with
hydrogen atoms replaced by a variety of functional groups, forming
families of organic compounds:

<ul>
  <li> <b>alcohols</b>, with one or more hydroxyl groups
  <li> <b>amines</b>, with amino groups
  <li> <b>aldehydes</b>, with carbonyl groups
  <li> <b>ketones</b>, with carbonyl groups
    <li> <b>carboxylic acids</b>, with carboxyl groups
</ul>
