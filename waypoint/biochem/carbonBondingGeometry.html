<h4>Carbon Bonding</h4>

<img src="carbonBondingGeometry.png">

<p><b>a</b>. Carbon atoms have a characteristic tetrahedral arrangement of their
four single bonds.
<p><b>b</b>. C-C single bonds have freedom of rotation, as shown for the
compound ethane, CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>.
<p><b>c</b>. Double bonds are shorter and do not allow free rotation.  The two
doubly bonded carbons and the atoms designated A,B,X and Y all lie in
the same rigid plane.
