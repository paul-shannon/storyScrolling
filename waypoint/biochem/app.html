<h4>Carbon Bonding</h4>

<img src="carbonBondingGeometry.png">

<p><b>a</b>. Carbon atoms have a characteristic tetrahedral arrangement of their
four single bonds.
<p><b>b</b>. C-C single bonds have freedom of rotation, as shown for the
compound ethane, CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>.
<p><b>c</b>. Double bonds are shorter and do not allow free rotation.  The two
doubly bonded carbons and the atoms designated A,B,X and Y all lie in
the same rigid plane.

<h4>Hydrocarbon Molecules</h4>

Covalently linked carbon atoms in biomolecules can form linear chains,
branched chains, and cyclic structures.  This bonding versatility
likely led to the selection of carbon
compounds for the molecular machinery of cells during the origin
and evolution of living organisms.  No other element can form
molecules of such widely different sizes, shapes, and composition.
<p>

Most biomolecules can be regarded as derivatives of hydrocarbons, with
hydrogen atoms replaced by a variety of functional groups, forming
families of organic compounds:

<ul>
  <li> <b>alcohols</b>, with one or more hydroxyl groups
  <li> <b>amines</b>, with amino groups
  <li> <b>aldehydes</b>, with carbonyl groups
  <li> <b>ketones</b>, with carbonyl groups
    <li> <b>carboxylic acids</b>, with carboxyl groups
</ul>

<h4>Alcohols</h4>

<img src="alcoholMolecule.png">

An alcohol is a type of organic compount that carries at least one
hydroxyl <b>-OH</b> functional group bound to carbon.
<p>
Alcohols range from the simple, like methanol and ethanol, to complex,
like sugars and cholesterol.
<p>
  The presence of an <b>OH</b> group strongly modified the properties
  of hydrocarbons, conferring hydrophyllic properties.
<p>
  The <b>OH</b> group provides a stat at which many reactions occur.

<h4>Sterols and Cholesterol</h4>

Cholesterol is the principal sterol of all higher animals,
distributed in body tissues, especially the brain and spinal
      cord, and in animal fats and oils.
      <img src="sterol.png">

<p>
  Sterol is an organic compound with formula
C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O, whose molecule is derived from that of
gonane by replacement of a hydrogen atom on C3 position by a hydroxyl
group. It is therefore an alcohol of gonane. More generally, any
compounds that contain the gonane structure, additional functional
groups, and/or modified ring systems derived from gonane are called
steroids. Therefore, sterols are a subgroup of the steroids. They
occur naturally in most eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and
fungi, and can also be produced by some bacteria (however likely with
different functions). The most familiar type of animal sterol is
cholesterol, which is vital to cell membrane structure, and functions
as a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones.

      <p>
While technically alcohols, sterols are classified by biochemists as
lipids (fats in the broader sense of the term).

      <h4> Function in membranes</h4>

Cholesterol is present in varying degrees in all animal cell
membranes, but is absent in prokaryotes. It is required to build
and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range
of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group of each cholesterol
molecule interacts with water molecules surrounding the membrane, as
do the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids,
while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the
membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other
lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid
chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters
membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal
cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most
bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being
rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

<p>

The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to
the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a trans
conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and
planar. In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the
permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, hydrogen
ions, and sodium ions.
