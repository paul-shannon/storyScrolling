<h4>Sterols and Cholesterol</h4>

Cholesterol is the principal sterol of all higher animals,
distributed in body tissues, especially the brain and spinal
      cord, and in animal fats and oils.

<p>
  Sterol is an organic compound with formula
C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O, whose molecule is derived from that of
gonane by replacement of a hydrogen atom on C3 position by a hydroxyl
group. It is therefore an alcohol of gonane. More generally, any
compounds that contain the gonane structure, additional functional
groups, and/or modified ring systems derived from gonane are called
steroids. Therefore, sterols are a subgroup of the steroids. They
occur naturally in most eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and
fungi, and can also be produced by some bacteria (however likely with
different functions). The most familiar type of animal sterol is
cholesterol, which is vital to cell membrane structure, and functions
as a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones.

      <p>
While technically alcohols, sterols are classified by biochemists as
lipids (fats in the broader sense of the term).

      <h4> Function in membranes</h4>

Cholesterol is present in varying degrees in all animal cell
membranes, but is absent in prokaryotes. It is required to build
and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range
of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group of each cholesterol
molecule interacts with water molecules surrounding the membrane, as
do the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids,
while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the
membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other
lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid
chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters
membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal
cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most
bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being
rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

<p>

The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to
the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a trans
conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and
planar. In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the
permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, hydrogen
ions, and sodium ions.
