  <h3> Wild Thought</h3>
"Wild thought" and not "the thought of wild men." For this book
departs from traditional ethnology in taking as its theme a universal
aspect of the human mind: thought in its wild state, flourishing in
every human mind -contemporary or ancient, near or far-insofar as it
has not been cultivated and domesticated to increase its yield.
<p>
<p>  
Certainly, one can seek examples of wild thought among societies
without writing and without machines; even here, this thought
singularly resembles that which we find at work around ourselves, in
poetry and art or, again, in the diverse forms of popular lore,
whether archaic or recent.

<p>
<p>
In wild thought, there is nothing
disorderly or confused. Starting from an observation of the world that
bears witness to an often stupefying sense of detail and precision, it
analyzes, differentiates, classes, combines, and opposes... In this
book, consequently, myths, rituals, beliefs, and other cultural facts
appear as "wild" beings comparable, beyond language, to all those that
nature (from which we cannot separate the human mind) also gives birth
to in innumerable animal, plant, and mineral forms. It should not
surprise us, then, that over millennia of cohabitation, wild thought
should have found in these forms the material and inspiration for a
logic whose laws are limited to transposing the properties of the
real, and that for this very reason permitted men to grasp it.
